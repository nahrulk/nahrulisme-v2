The challenge lies not in complexity, but in daring to look where no one else has. Science requires courage — to ask, to observe, and to think beyond doctrine. Once revealed, truth becomes undeniable, even if it was once heresy.",

The theory of relativity began with a thought, not a formula. Creative thinking allows us to break free from limitations and envision new realities. In science and in life, it is the dreamers who reshape the world.",

Knowledge brings power, and with it, the confidence to face uncertainty with clarity and purpose.",
